This page mainly features slides from my presentations in Prof. Lin’s lab meetings.



**Coloc + finemapping**: Treat SuSiE’s credible sets/PIPs as a quantification of causal-variant uncertainty, so colocalization moves from a single-variant comparison to a probabilistic integration over a set of plausible causal signals.

**Mash:** Learn which tissues/conditions tend to share effects from the data, then use those shared patterns for shrinkage to pull noisy estimates toward more reliable structure. (<a href="/files/slides/mash.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a>)



**Efron's empirical Bayes method for multiple testing:** Use a Poisson GLM to estimate the empirical null and compute lfdr, framing multiple testing as empirical Bayes shrinkage toward the null. (<a href="/files/slides/lfdr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a>)



**APCH:** Present the APCH method and its key ideas. (<a href="/files/slides/APCH_30mins.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download PDF</a>)
