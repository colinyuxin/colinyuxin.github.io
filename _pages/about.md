Hi! I’m **Yuxin Li (李予昕)**, an undergraduate student in Data Science at **Fudan University** (B.S. expected 2026). My research interests lie in **statistical genetics** and in developing **computational methods for complex traits**, especially methods that connect genome-wide association signals to interpretable biological mechanisms.

I am currently working with Prof. Xiaolei Lin at Fudan on method development for cross-trait genetic association, and with Prof. Xin He at the University of Chicago on linking polygenic risk scores to multi-tissue gene-expression patterns. I will add a separate page with more details about these projects soon.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing Go (围棋), travelling, and exploring new places in my spare time.
