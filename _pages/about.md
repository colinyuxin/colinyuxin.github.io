Hi! I’m **Yuxin Li (李予昕)**, an undergraduate student in Data Science at **Fudan University** (B.S. expected 2026). My research interests lie in **statistical genetics** , **Bayesian method** and in developing **computational methods for genetics and genomic data** , especially methods that connect genome-wide association signals to interpretable biological mechanisms.

I am currently working with [Prof. Xiaolei Lin](https://xiaolei-lin.github.io/) at Fudan on method development for cross-trait genetic association, and with [Prof. Xin He](https://xinhelab.org/) at the University of Chicago on linking polygenic risk scores to multi-tissue gene-expression patterns.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing Go (围棋), travelling, and exploring new places in my spare time. I’m also very open to potential research collaborations.
