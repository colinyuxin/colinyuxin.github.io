Here are some of the projects I am currently working on or have recently worked on.

## Adaptive Partial Conjunction Hypothesis (APCH)

I work with [Prof. Xiaolei Lin](https://xiaolei-lin.github.io/) at Fudan on methods for **cross-trait genetic association**. Our recent work proposes the *Adaptive Partial Conjunction Hypothesis* (APCH), which uses summary statistics to identify pleiotropic loci across heterogeneous effect units while controlling false discoveries.

I helped design and implement the inference procedure, run large-scale simulations, and apply APCH to type 2 diabetes–related GWAS traits. The method is available as an R package and a bioRxiv preprint:

- Preprint: [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.11.25.690340)  
- Code: [APCH R package](https://github.com/colinyuxin/APCH)

## Polygenic risk and multi-tissue gene expression

With [Prof. Xin He](https://xinhelab.org/) at the University of Chicago, I work on linking **polygenic risk scores (PRS)** for complex diseases (such as type 2 diabetes) to **multi-tissue gene-expression patterns**.

I build analysis pipelines that take partitioned PRS, perform differential expression, pathway enrichment, and clustering analyses in tissues like adipose, liver and skeletal muscle, and then summarize the results into interpretable pathway themes and potential biomarkers.
